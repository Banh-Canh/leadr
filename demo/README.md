# leadr Demo

This directory contains all files used to create the demo video for leadr.
To use the demo mappings, source the `source_me.sh` file which will set the `LEADR_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to this directory.

The demo then consists of the mappings that run the individual parts of the `explain_demo.sh` script and the corresponding commands demonstrating the functionality of leadr.
To run the script, `pv` (pipe viewer) is required which is used to add the typing effect to the output to make it more readable.
